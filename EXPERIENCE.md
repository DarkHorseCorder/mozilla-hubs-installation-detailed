## My experience installing on alibaba elastic compute service

Im from indonesia and some guy in china ask me to install this hubs on their server. via ssh remote.

The hardware is 8cpu 32g ram 40gb disk

### - Download or server internet is slow

You can use the VPN, i use nord VPN and select hongkong location (nearest). in this vpn not provide connection directly on mainland china.
so i choose hongkong that near from china. then the server internet by magic is fast hahaha.

### - OS and Python version

Using ubuntu 18 (python 3.6) i got many problem. then i ask him to install ubuntu 20.

Ubuntu 20 comes with python 3.8 which is supporting the mediasoup v3 in dialog 

[requirement for mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/)

### - Github empty response
When i install spoke with `yarn install` it says can't connect blabla...
then i run `ping github.com` and got 100% lost packet.

then i restart the server

`sudo reboot`

and still not work.

then i do [gnutls_handshake() failed GIT repository â€“ AWS codecommit](https://devopscube.com/gnutls-handshake-failed-aws-codecommit/) and [How to resolve "git pull,fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com...\': Empty reply from server"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27087483/how-to-resolve-git-pull-fatal-unable-to-access-https-github-com-empty)

and still not work

then i just `git clone the repo` like `three.js` and `gltf-webpack-loader` then i make it local library (on vps) with `yarn link`

and on `package.json` in spoke dir i remove that `three.js` and `gltf-webpack-loader` 

so i do 
```
yarn install
yarn link three
yarn link gltf-webpack-loader
```
