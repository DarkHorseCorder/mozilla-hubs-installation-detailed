## Introduction

After [installing mozilla hubs on local](https://github.com/albirrkarim/mozilla-hubs-installation-detailed/blob/main/README.md) and [Hosting Mozilla Hubs on VPS](https://github.com/albirrkarim/mozilla-hubs-installation-detailed/blob/main/VPS_FOR_HUBS.md) i started to modify it.

Give me star if you think this repo is good.

## Where is the database schema?

`priv/repo/migrations/`

above contains the migration files.
